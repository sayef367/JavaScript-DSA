### Array
- An array is a data structure that can hold a collection of values.
- Array can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same array.
- Arrays are resizable, You don't have to declare the size of an array before creating it.
- JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertion order is maintained.
- Arrays are iterables, They can be used with a for of loop.

## array - Big-0 time complexity
- insert/remove from end - 0(1)
- insert/remove from beginning - 0(n)
- access - 0(1)
- search - 0(n)
- push/pop - 0(1)
- access - 0(1)
- shift/unshift/concat/slice/splice - 0(n)
- forEach/map/filter/reduce - 0(n)
