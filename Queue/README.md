## Queue
- The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO).
- The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed.
- A queue of people, People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/head).
- Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
- The Queue dat structure supports two main operations:
    - Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection.
    - Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection.
