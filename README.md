## JavaScript Data Structure
I solve the DSA to different types of data structures and algorithms and their implementations in JavaScript.

## What is a Data Structure?
- A data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

## DSA Roadmap step by step
### Built in data structures 
- Array.js
- Object.js
- Set.js
- Map.js
### Custom data Structures 
- Stack.js
- Queue.js
    - queue1.js //using an array
    - queue2.js //using an object
    - CircularQueue.js
- Linked List
    - prependLinkedList //it's 0(1)
    - appendLinkedList.js //it's 0(n)
    - linkedListNode.js
    - headTailPointer.js
    - linkedListStack.js
    - linkedListQueue.js
- HashTable.js
- Tree
    - BinarySearchTree.js
- Graph
