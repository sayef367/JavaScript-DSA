## JavaScript Data Structure
I solve the DSA to different types of data structures and algorithms and their implementations in JavaScript.

## What is a Data Structure?
- A data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

## DSA Roadmap step by step
### Built in data structures 
- Array
- Object
- Set
- Map
### Custom data Structures 
- Stack
- Queue
    - queue1 //using an array
    - queue2 //using an object
    - Circular Queue
- Linked List
    - prependLinkedList //it's 0(1)
    - appendLinkedList.js //it's 0(n)
