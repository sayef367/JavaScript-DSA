<h1>JavaScript Data Structure</h1>
<p>I solve the DSA to different types of data structures and algorithms and their implementations in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>What is a Data Structure?</h2>
- A data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

<h2>DSA Roadmap step by step</h2>
- Built in data structures - array, object, set, map</li>
- Custom data Structures - stack, queue, circular queue, linked list, hash table, tree. graph.
