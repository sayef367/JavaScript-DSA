## Linked List
- Alinked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.
- Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node.
- The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.
- Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity.
- The linked list data structure supports three main operations
    - Insertion - to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the list.
    - Deletion - to remove an item given it's index or value.
    - Search - to find an element given it's value.
